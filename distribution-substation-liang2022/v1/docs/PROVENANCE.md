# Provenance

This dataset is adapted from Liang (2022), which described an example 110/220 kV distribution substation, illustrated in the paper's Figure 6(A).

## Source
- Liang, H., Blagojevic, N., Xie, Q., & Stojadinovic, B. (2022). Seismic risk analysis of electrical substations based on the network analysis method. Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics, 51(11), 2690-2707.

## Processing
- Original schematic and description were manually digitized into `nodes.json` and `edges.json`.
- Macrocomponent–equipment mapping in the paper's Table 1 was encoded into `macrocomponents.json`.
- Equipment fragility parameters (`mu`, `beta`) were assigned from the paper’s data in Table 2.
- `probs.json` was generated by computing edge failure probabilities based on a PGA value as illustrated in ../scripts/demo.ipynb.
- All files were curated in JSON for machine readability.

## Notes
- Coordinates in `nodes.json` are schematic, not geographical.
