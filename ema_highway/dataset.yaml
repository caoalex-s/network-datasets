description: >
  Eastern Massachusetts (EMA) schematic highway network intended for testing
  network reliability algorithms. Includes nodes, edges, and example
  probability files (binary and multi-state). Edges are undirected
  (directed: false) and lengths are in kilometers computed from planar
  coordinates.
