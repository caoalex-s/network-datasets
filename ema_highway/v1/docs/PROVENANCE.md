# Provenance

This dataset represents the EMA highway benchmark network data.

## Relevant publications
- Byun, J. E., Ryu, H. & Straub, D. (2024). Branch-and-bound algorithm for efficient reliability analysis of general coherent systems. arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.22363.

## Processing Notes
- Nodes and edges were manually digitised into `nodes.json` and `edges.json`.
- `probs_bin.json` and `probs_mult.json` were generated assuming simple probability distributions over edges.

## Notes
- Coordinates in `nodes.json` are planar coordinates in kilometres (not geodetic).
